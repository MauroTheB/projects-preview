### Project Previews

Here are the links to the current previews of my projects:

- **Maze's Soul** (Screencast Trailer): [Watch the trailer on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12W3EX7RABc43gZaFWH8LvWc5JIsfaUO5/view)
  - *Description*: The game examines how a player's mind retains a 2D representation of the game world and applies it to a 3D view of the same world. 
    The game starts with a 30-second look at a maze, where the start and exit points are marked. When the timer runs out, the view smoothly transitions 
    to a third-person perspective behind the player. From this point, the player must navigate the maze by recalling the path to the exit seen earlier 
    in the 2D view. Players can use potions found around the map or purchased from hidden vendors to help them find their way out of the maze.

  - *Description*: University project - Implement behavior for an agent with circular movements on a plane, so that it moves along tangent circles 
    and never falls off the plane it rests on.

  - *Description*: University project - Implement intelligence for an agent to navigate a hilly terrain generated with Perlin noise, ensuring it avoids 
    being submerged by a tide that rises and falls, making some areas underwater.
